## Projects
This folder contains individual project folders, each with its own code, documentation, and detailed README.

### Parallel Computing
- **MPI BFS – 8 Puzzle:**  
  A project that implements a parallel breadth-first search using MPI to solve the 8-puzzle problem. The report details the design, load balancing, and performance improvements achieved through distributed computing.
- **OpenMP N-Queens:**  
  An OpenMP-based solution for the N-Queens problem that explores efficient thread synchronization and workload distribution. Documentation includes performance analysis for different threading models.
- **Teacher specification for both assignments**  

### Computer Architecture
- **Processor Simulation & Benchmarking:**  
  Projects involving simulations of DLX processors and experiments with vector-based and segmented architectures. These projects analyze key performance metrics such as CPI and throughput.
- **Vector Processing Analysis:**  
  A project focusing on the design and performance evaluation of vector processing units, highlighting the impact of hardware design on parallel computations.

### Automata Theory & Compiler Construction
The compiler translates basic control structures and arithmetic expressions into executable code by following these key steps:

1. Lexical Analysis: Implemented a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) to convert source code characters into meaningful tokens.

2. Syntactic Analysis: Developed a recursive descent parser that uses a context-free grammar to validate the structure of the code.

3. Semantic Analysis & Code Generation: Integrated semantic checks during parsing and converted infix expressions to postfix notation, enabling execution on a stack-based virtual machine.

### Data Structures & Algorithms
- **Core Data Structures & Algorithms:**  
  Implementations of fundamental data structures (lists, dictionaries, trees). 

### Econometrics
- **Econometrics Project Report:**  
  A detailed PDF report documenting an ordinal regression project. 

## Certificates
This folder includes PDFs of relevant certifications, such as:
- IELTS Academic Certificate. 

## Final Note
Thank you for reviewing my portfolio. Although I may still be in the early stages of my research journey, I am incredibly eager to learn, deepen my understanding of scientific computing and advanced system concepts, and continuously improve my skills. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to grow as a researcher and contribute meaningfully to the innovative projects at BSC.
